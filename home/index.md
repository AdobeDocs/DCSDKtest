# Introduction

## Announcements

.. note:: The `DC Services SDK <./servicessdk/index.html>`__ and `DC View SDK <./viewsdk/index.html>`__ are now available for early access. This version of the SDK provides JAVA APIs, documentation, and sample code.  

## What is the DC SDK?

Despite its near ubiquity, supporting PDF viewing on the web or in applications often remains a multi-step process where the developer relies on disparate browser implementations and simply doesn't own the end-to-end customer experience. This means that organizations have little control over their PDF workflows and PDF integration often requires additional downloads or sending users to 3rd party applications. 

The Document Cloud SDK changes that. With tools and language support that caters to web developers' existing skillsets, you can now create compelling PDF experiences, including viewing, exporting and creating PDFs. The DC SDK is part of the Adobe Platform--an ecosystem aimed at helping 3rd party application developers embed Adobe services, develop custom apps, and leverage Adobe products and technology in their solutions. The DC SDK provides tools that allow you to easily create seamless PDF viewing experiences in websites and applications. 

The early access delivers two SDKs: `DC Services SDK <./servicessdk/index.html>`__ and `DC View SDK <./viewsdk/index.html>`__.  Whether you're developing a web app or web site, these SDK automate the generation, manipulation, and transformation of content via a set of modern cloud-based APIs. The DC SDKs help you deliver simpler, faster, and branded experiences so that you control user interaction with your documents, streamline PDF workflows and promote usage and retention. 

These PDF SDKs represent a paradigm shift in the way PDF workflows exist and interact with your environment and digital documents. The SDK is in an early stage of development, and Adobe is rapidly evolving and expanding it to support additional use cases. We are also continually enhancing the SDKs, including the APIs, sample code, and documentation.

## The power of PDF viewing in your app 

The DC View SDK delivers JavaScript-based interfaces designed to help developers harness the power of integrated PDF in their web content. With the ability to natively display PDF in an environment you control, you no longer need to rely on Reader download buttons, 3rd party apps, and PDF viewers that care little for PDF standards. With web-based JavaScript and in-page JS options, displaying a PDF on the web couldn't be easier. And it's simple: a couple of lines of code is all you need to get started. While the initial beta release showcases basic features, future releases will deliver a broad range of viewer features and a rich experience PDF user have come to take for granted. 

## Feedback welcome!

Customer feedback during the beta program is particularly valuable as it helps the team validate use cases, guide development, and troubleshoot issues.
